The top level module is CCellular, which 
Each manager provides a service (for example, network manager)

This division is to allow the different parts of dAuth to be developed and managed independently
If a new implementation of a given service is to be used (swapping out the DB, for instance), 
the hope is that the manager (or at least its interface) should remain the same to prevent any
need for changing the other managers.

The main components are as follows:

CCellular (the central manager)
- maintains the managers in the system, and controls basics functions like start, stop, and logging.

Managers:
- Database Manager: Any database functionality is provided by this manager. This includes operations and triggers.

- Network Manager: Provides network services (such as logging) and allows for message prioritizations

- Distributed Manager: Provides consensus amoung other nodes

- Test Manager: Simple manager that verifies the CCellular is functioning
