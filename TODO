Major areas to work on:

> Add database manager:
  - A lot of the work should be done in the original dAuth
  - Figure out how to appropriately run Mongodb with replicant
  - Maybe steal the dbconf.sh script from nextepc?
  - Add configuration options to config and parser

> Add distributed manager:
  - Again, a lot of the work should be done
  - Figure out the transaction processor, how it work, what to give it
  - Figure out the validator and how to set it up
  - Add configuration options to config and parser

> Add protobuf messages:
  - The real managers need protobuf to talk
  - For now, all that is needed is the database data protobuf

> Unit testing:
  - Add unit tests to the testing package
  - As a start, make a basic framework test with the test managers
  - Tests for each manager separately would be good too
  - Finally, some way of testing the entire system
