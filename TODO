Major areas to work on:

> Database Manager Issues:
  - Update and delete triggers do not have remote and ownership data, creates issue with propagation
  -- Fix that uses dicts with pending info has been used, works for now

> Add distributed manager:
  - Again, a lot of the work should be done
  - Figure out the transaction processor, how it work, what to give it
  - Figure out the validator and how to set it up
  - Add configuration options to config and parser

> Unit testing:
  - Add unit tests to the testing package
  - As a start, make a basic framework test with the test managers
  - Tests for each manager separately would be good too
  - Finally, some way of testing the entire system
