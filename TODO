Major areas to work on:

> Database Manager:
  - Update and delete triggers do not have remote and ownership data, creates issue with propagation
  -- Fix that uses dicts with pending info has been used, works for now

> Distributed manager:
  - Figure out occasional crashes (Possibly relate to engine getting unhandled pings?)

> Testing:
  - Add testing for each Manager
  - Improve performance test
  - Use real testing data

> Proto:
  - Change to new format / data (both proto and wrapper)

> Overall:
  - Transaction ordering? Add a sequence number to databases?
  -- Assumes no two databases are working on same data within a given time frame 
  -- (different operation for same seqnums possible otherwise)

> Rework Database Manager:
  - Start with reworking the database operation wrapper, it needs to be toned down (less abstraction)
  - Refactor / rework the manager and triggers. Needs a smarter way to hold onto ids and
