This guide only covers using dAuth, NOT sawtooth or mongo

Install
-------
1. Create a virtual environment ('virtualenv -p python3 venv'), 
    then activate it ('source venv/bin/activate')
2. Install dAuth with 'pip install -e .'


Setup
-------
1. Make sure Sawtooth is running and accessible by dAuth
2. Make sure the Mongo DBs are running accessible by dAuth
3. [Optional] set up the logging server via:
    'python network/logging_server.py [port]' or 
    'logging-server [port]'
4. Start dAuth by running 
    'python dAuth/main.py [options]' or
    'dauth-main [options]'
4a. List the options using '--help'
 *Note: Most config options are available as command line args, 
        but some may need to be done manually (in dAuth/config.py)


Testing
--------
There are two test docker compose yamls that make sawtooth and mongo easy
1. Start sawtooth by running 'docker-compose -f ./docker/sawtooth-poet.yaml up'
   (for single node testing, run 'docker-compose -f ./docker/sawtooth-solo.yaml up')
2. Start a mongo replica setup with 'docker-compose -f ./docker/mongodb_setup.yaml up'
3. Run a dAuth test, there are many example under dAuth/testing (some may be out of date)
4. Between tests, make sure to reset the sawtooth nodes by bringing it down, 
    then pruning containers and volumes
