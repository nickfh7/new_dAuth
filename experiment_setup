General Idea:
- Assumes 3 nodes, and possible one outside machine (i.e. for sending transactions)
- Run dAuth on every node, collect all logs in one place, use script to extract results

Steps:

0. Repo
  - Clone this: https://github.com/nickfh7/new_dAuth
  - Switch to the 'exp' branch

1. Setup python environment (for every node and outside machine)
  - In the top level of the repo, run:
    - "virtualenv -p python3 venv"
    - "source venv/bin/activate"
    - "pip install -e ."

2. Start supporting programs (one node or outside machine):
  - Logging server, which collects logs from other nodes
    - Must be accessible via network for other nodes
    - Worst case, if this doesn't work, you'll need to manually collect logs from each node
    - In the top level, run "python network/logging_server.py [port]"
      - Port is optional, default is 14127

3. Run dAuth (for every node):
  - Main file is "dAuth/main.py"
  - All default configurations are in "dAuth/config.py"
  - In the top level, run:
    - "dAuth/main.py --help" for a list of options
    - "dAuth/main.py [options]" to run the node
    - There is a script "./experiment_run.sh" which shows this

4. Collect results:
  - Run "python exp_results.py <logfile directory> [output file]"
    - The logfile directory should contain all logfiles (Assumes no duplicates!)
    - If no output file is specified, just outputs to stdout
    - Displays a number of useful breakdowns of the data
